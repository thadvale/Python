# Python
Thaddeus Vale's Python Project 2021

Welcome to my Python Project, over the last year during the pandemic I have been self-learning Python. 

In the Python Project 2021 file you can view the source code to get an idea of where my current understanding is with the language, and my style of code. 

Note that the source code is under Creative Commons so that other students learning Python can use or reference the source-code to increase their own knowledge. 

For questions, you can reach me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/thadvale/
